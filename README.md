# UFO Sightings.

##Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. With the help of javascript and an html page, the user will be able to have a table with the information about the sightings, being able to filter the information by city, state, country, shape, or date.

This will help the user to have the accessibility and only focused on the information that will be needed, instead of having to search in all the data.

##Results

When the user use the UFO sightings project, the user will have a filter search for each category, date, city, state, country and shape

- The user only has to enter the information required in a specific filter search, depending on what the user want to get.


- The user can use more than one filter, for example you can filter by a specific date, and then by state.

- If the user want to restart the table, the information just has to be erased, and start filtering again.

In the date filter, the html page give us the format we should use as you can see in the image below.

The city, state and country filter behave almost the same, the page give us an example of what we should put in the black space, we can see that for the state and country we only use the abbreviation of them, like ca for California, and us for USA.

Finally the shape filter referred to the shape of the sighting, the example that the page use is a no-common shape (light), the user have to be aware of the different types of sighting shapes the data has.


##Summary

One drawback of our project is that if a user is not familiarized with the information that is used to filter the table, the user wouldn’t know which words to use, for example in shape, “light”, is not a common word to describe shape.

- One recommendation will be to use a menu, with the possible filter words per category.

- Another recommendation is to add a duration filter, in case the user want to filter by this category.
